# Food Item Recognition and Calorie Estimation

## Overview
This project develops a model to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101), which contains images of 101 different types of food.

## Usage
The code is implemented in Jupyter Lab and can be found in this repository.

## Acknowledgments
